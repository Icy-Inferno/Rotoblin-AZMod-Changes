// Mission files describe the metadata needed by campaign-specific add-ons so they can be 
// integrated into Left 4 Dead. The data in this file is used by the game UI, matchmaking and server.
// Although you may provide multiple Campaigns in one add-on by putting more than one .TXT file 
// in the missions folder, it's generally a good idea to stick to one per add-on.
//
// HOW TO DEBUG MISSION FILES:
// - In the console set "developer 2"
// - Then type "mission_reload"
//
// This will make the game reload all the mission files and print out every chapter for every mode it
// finds.  It's very useful to ensure that your mission file is being correctly read.

	//
	// "versus_boss_spawning"
	// In versus games, there are a set of console variables that are used to govern how witches and 
	// tanks spawn. If you wish to override those defaults for a map in this campaign, you can do that here. 
	// If you don't specify a mapma or a specific value for a map, 
	// it will use the console variables defaults instead.

	// spawn_pos_min - (float: 0.01 ... 0.99)
	//	The minimum random position on a map to spawn a boss. 
	//	0.01 means right near the beginning, 0.99 means near the end
	// 
	// spawn_pos_max - (float: 0.01 ... 0.99)
	//	The maximum random position on a map to spawn a boss. 
	//	0.01 means right near the beginning, 0.99 means near the end
	//
	// tank_chance - (float: 0.0 ... 1.0)
	//	The random chance that a Tank will spawn, 0 being never and 1 being always.
	//
	// witch_chance - (float: 0.0 ... 1.0)
	//	The random chance that a witch will spawn, 0 being never and 1 being always.
	//
	// witch_and_tank - (int: 0 or 1)
	//	If both a witch and a tank randomly spawn, this controls whether 
	// 	the tank is supressed in favor of the witch. 
	// 	0 means only spawn the witch if they would both spawn, 1 means spawn them both.
